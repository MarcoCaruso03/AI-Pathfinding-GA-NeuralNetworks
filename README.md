# Artificial Intelligence - Academic Projects 2025/2026

This repository contains a collection of three comprehensive projects (Assignments) developed for the **Artificial Intelligence** course during the 2025/2026 academic year. Each project explores a core pillar of AI: Search & Optimization, Evolutionary Computing, and Neural Networks.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. Search & Heuristics (A* Algorithm)
**Goal:** Optimize energy distribution and maintenance routes for a 20-station urban charging network.
- **Key Implementations:** Advanced A* Search, custom admissible heuristics based on BFS-graph distance, and multi-scenario pathfinding (Emergency, Maintenance, and Energy Balancing).
- **Core Concepts:** State-space search, dominance criteria, and cost-energy constraints.

### 2. Evolutionary Computing (Feature Selection)
**Goal:** Feature selection for the DARWIN dataset (Alzheimer’s handwriting analysis) using Genetic Algorithms (GA).
- **Key Implementations:** Binary encoding, modular genetic operators (Roulette vs. Tournament selection), and fitness functions based on correlation analysis.
- **Analysis:** Statistical study of population dynamics, convergence rates, and parameter tuning (Mutation/Crossover rates) over 30+ runs.

### 3. Neural Networks (Supervised Learning)
**Goal:** Diagnostic classification of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).
- **Key Implementations:** Data standardization pipelines, Early Stopping logic, and hyperparameter optimization (Architecture, Activation functions, Alpha regularization).
- **Metrics:** Detailed diagnostic analysis using ROC Curves, AUC, and Confusion Matrices to minimize False Negatives in a clinical context.
